# NOTE: 
# - The Directory structure needs to be updated to template structure. Its likely to remain static. 
# - Not all these opperations need to happend in an instance. Implement passing prameter into these to execute the funtions.
# - This is not fully automation as between S2 and S3 manual labor needs to get done. If this gets automated in the future then just call the sript in a updateTemplate function.
# - This is a fast build prototype / proof of concept. I know how bad it is to have everything hard coded.
# - I belive this does not work if the files or folders currently exist. Need to encapusate all logic in try catch.
# Notes from Dan:
# - Keep in mind when Adding speadsheet, get the names from a file, Speadsheet name -> Conversion Name.
# - Speadsheet name changes
